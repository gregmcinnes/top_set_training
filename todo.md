program selector is a little confusing
we should mention in the onboarding program selector that you can make custom programs from settings


need to be able to change sets and reps of accessories
trying to change a primary lift opens a "Select Lift' dialog that shows not options. 
Rest timer selector is bad. it should be a dropdown not a button group
superset and plate calculator in on boarding should be shown as pro features
ready to begin summary shows internal name, not display name
need to show display name at top of workout screen, not internal name
starting a new cycle should take you to week 1 of the new program

share your result - share your change in training max from the beginning to end (or current point) of cycle to social media
